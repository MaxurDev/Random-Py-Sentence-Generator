# Random-Py-Sentence-Generator
A basic template for a simple python program that can generate random sentences (the template comes with only 5 words in this sentence)

## How to use:
Change the list of words that come within the inital python list, this can be tedious 
so I recommend creating a seperate file that can be accessed by the list.

If you want to add more words in the sentence just created another list and a variable for choosing a word
I.e in the template I use the variable "
